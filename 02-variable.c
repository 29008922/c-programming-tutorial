/*
What is a variable in programming?
In programming, a variable is a container (storage area) to hold data.

To indicate the storage area, each variable should be given
a unique name (identifier). Variable names are just the
symbolic representation of a memory location.

Rules for naming a variable
- A variable name can only have letters (both uppercase
and lowercase letters), digits and underscore.
- The first letter of a variable should be either a letter or an underscore.
- There is no rule on how long a variable name (identifier) can be.
However, you may run into problems in some compilers if the
variable name is longer than 31 characters.

Note: You should always try to give meaningful names to
variables. For example: firstName is a better variable name than fn.

In C, variable names should be preceded by a datatype,
to tell the compiler what type of data we storing in the variable.

Syntax -
datatype variableName = value;
